###### NOTES

I would have liked to:

- translate pagination
- be more aware of responsiveness
- placeholder for gallery when images are missing
- proper toast for success and error messages, not browser's tool.
- better design decisions (color, font-sizes, etc.)
- Footer
- navegacion al listado de propiedades
- tarjeta de propiedades mejorada
- better testing
  [x] properties detail image processing should be a separate function

- Imagen de home
- Imagen de detail
- Video de pagination
- Video de form submission
- Imagen form success
- Imagen form error

- Test coverage
- Imagen test coverage
